/* 
=================================================
Script for modular system for NTE's script system
=================================================
As NTE uses the same variable context for each
script in a script_files[], just putting separate
scripts there would make them conflict with each
other. This script as a framework that would
solve that.

USAGE:
1. Put this script in the beginning of scripts list:
"script_files": ["mtr:metropack/scripts/framework.js", "mtr:metropack/scripts/script1.js", "mtr:metropack/scripts/script2.js", ...]

2. Change all scripts to use following syntax:
create_queue.push(function (ctx, state, train) {});
dispose_queue.push(function (ctx, state, train) {});
render_queue.push(function (ctx, state, train) {});
